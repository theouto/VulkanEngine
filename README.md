# Vulkan rendering engine

Vulkan based rendering engine written mostly from scratch, utilising the GLFW, GLM, tinyobjloader.h and stb_image.h libraries.

Still barebones, but updates are planned. Done almost entirely for learning purposes.

Current progress: improved? Diffuse model, working on a shader overhaul. Currently incomplete.
